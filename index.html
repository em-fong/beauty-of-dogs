  <h2> Imagine this: </h2>
  <article>
  <p class="text"> You are walking down a nice residential street, surrounded by the first signs of autumn foliage. "This is nice," you think to yourself.
      "Peace and quiet in Manhattan? Unheard of!" You keep walking, enjoying the small oasis of nature in the concrete jungle when suddenly, you see
      a huge, <em> fluffy</em>, dog! You approach the magnificent doggo, who responds with a wagging tail and bright eyes, eager to meet a new friend.
      At the last second, you look up at the dog owner's face, who scowls, as if to say <em> don't you dare </em> before dragging the dog away from you.
      Disheartened, you continue on your walk as the dog strolls past you.

      <br> <br>

      Who hasn't experienced this kind of moment in New York, the land of a million dogs and eight million angry people? As a result, people have flocked
      to places like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/dogspotting/"> Dogspotting </a>, but another issue arises: what kind of dog is the best kind?
      There are no bad dogs, but there certainly are fluffier (see: Figure 1), friendlier, or more lovable ones. This site helps you make the responsible decision of deciding
      what kind of dog really is the best dog. </p>
